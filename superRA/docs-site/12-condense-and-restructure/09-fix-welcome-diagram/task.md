## Objective

The three-phase (PLAN → IMPLEMENT → INTEGRATE → finished) diagram on `docs/site/01-welcome/task.md` renders badly in doc-mode. The phase boxes and "finished" pill stack fine, but the **"plan change loops back to PLAN"** element — a dashed vertical line + arrow + caption — floats detached to the right, disconnected from the boxes, so the loop-back reads as a stray sidebar rather than a cycle returning to PLAN.

Rework the diagram so the feedback loop reads clearly as "a plan change routes back to PLAN," and the whole thing looks clean in the rendered doc-mode page.

- **Reference the README's diagram** (repo-root `README.md`) — it draws the same PLAN→IMPLEMENT→INTEGRATE flow with Mermaid and reads cleanly. First determine whether the doc-mode dashboard renders Mermaid: if it does, prefer replacing the hand-built HTML with a Mermaid diagram consistent with the README's; if it does not, fix the inline HTML/CSS so the loop-back connects visually to the flow (a proper return edge to PLAN, not a free-floating dashed line).
- Keep the same information: the three phases with their one-line contents, the "finished" end state, and the "plan change loops back to PLAN" feedback edge.
- This is a presentation fix only — do not change the surrounding prose or the Design Philosophy section.

**Verify against the live rendered output, not the source.** The doc-mode preview is already served (`./superRA/superra dashboard --doc-mode --root docs/site`); load the Welcome page and confirm the diagram renders correctly (loop-back connected, no floating/overlapping elements, no broken layout) before declaring done. Record what rendering approach you used (Mermaid vs fixed HTML) and why in `## Results`.

## Planner Guidance

If Mermaid is not supported in doc-mode, the minimal fix is to anchor the loop-back as a labeled return arrow within the same vertical flow (e.g. an edge from INTEGRATE/finished back up to PLAN), rather than a separate right-hand column with a dashed line that has nothing to connect to. Match the page's existing color variables.
