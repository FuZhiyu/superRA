## Objective

Resolve the task-system package from the locally installed plugin (Claude/Codex) at runtime so the `superra` CLI never installs anything, never creates a cwd venv, and always matches the installed plugin version; GitHub is a last-resort fallback.

### Problem

Running `uv run superra …` from a research project (not the superRA checkout) makes `uv` discover that project's `pyproject.toml` and try to provision its `.venv`, which fails when a `.venv` already exists (`File exists (os error 17)`) and is wrong in any case — the user's research environment must not be touched to run a task-tree CLI. The repo-local `superRA/superra` wrapper avoids this only because it hardcodes `uv run --project "$REPO_ROOT/skills/task-system"`, which assumes a checkout and so does not exist in a research project's task tree. Pinning the wrapper to a git tag instead would reintroduce drift: when the installed plugin advances, a pinned wrapper silently runs stale CLI against current task files.

The fix is to resolve the task-system package source from whatever plugin is **already installed on disk** and run it with `uvx --from <source>`, which builds an isolated env in uv's cache (no install step, no cwd venv) and always matches the installed version. Both harnesses install the plugin under a versioned cache path:

- Claude: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/superRA/<version>/skills/task-system`, with `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` recording `superRA@superRA.installPath` authoritatively.
- Codex: `~/.codex/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/superra/<version>/skills/task-system` (note lowercase plugin slug; no manifest file).

### Scope

1. **Source resolver.** Implement a fast, bounded resolution chain returning the task-system package directory (the dir containing `pyproject.toml`), in priority order:
   1. **Env var** `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` / `PLUGIN_ROOT` (set inside the harness) → `$VAR/skills/task-system`. Explicit harness signal; outranks everything.
   2. **Local checkout** — `$REPO_ROOT/skills/task-system/pyproject.toml` if present. Ordered above the installed caches *on purpose*: a contributor working in a checkout must get live edits, not the stale copied cache snapshot (see precedence rationale below). In a research project there is no checkout, so this branch is skipped and resolution falls through to the caches.
   3. **Claude cache (manifest)** — read `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (shape `{"version", "plugins": {"superRA@superRA": [records]}}`); from the records list pick the one whose `projectPath` matches the current task-tree's project, else the `scope: user` record (`projectPath: null`); append `/skills/task-system` to its `installPath`.
   4. **Codex cache** — bounded glob `~/.codex/plugins/cache/*/*/*/skills/task-system` (exactly three path segments — marketplace/plugin/version), pick the highest semver. Must not casing-assume the plugin slug (Codex uses lowercase `superra`, Claude uses `superRA`).
   5. **GitHub fallback** — `uvx --from "git+https://github.com/FuZhiyu/superRA.git@<tag>#subdirectory=skills/task-system"`. The only place a pin lives; it may lag the installed version and needs network on first build.
   - **Precedence rationale:** installs (Claude and Codex) are *copied* into versioned cache dirs (`…/cache/.../<version>/`), not symlinked to source, even for a local-directory (dev) marketplace — so a cache copy can lag a live working tree between updates. Hence checkout > caches for contributors; for end users (no checkout) the cache copy is the correct installed version.
   - **Speed gate:** no full-disk search. Resolution is env read + one file-exists test + single manifest read + one shallow fixed-depth glob. Cap the glob depth so it cannot walk the tree.
   - All local branches terminate in `uvx --from "<dir>" superra "$@"`.

2. **Wrapper generation.** Make the resolving wrapper the artifact a research project's task tree carries (replacing the checkout-only `uv run --project` assumption). The repo's own `superRA/superra` keeps the local-checkout branch preferred (so dev edits win) but carries the same chain so it is the canonical template.

3. **Agent-facing wrapper command.** Add a `superra` subcommand so agents create/refresh the wrapper without hand-authoring bash (e.g. `superra wrapper init [--root superRA]`). Idempotent; overwrites with the current resolver; sets the executable bit.

4. **Hook-shim alignment.** Extend `hooks/task-hook` to the full chain (it currently does env → checkout only; add Claude manifest, Codex cache, GitHub fallback). Keep the resolution logic single-sourced between the hook shim and the generated wrapper so they cannot drift (shared snippet emitted by the generator, or a sourced resolver the in-plugin shim reads from its own dir — the generated wrapper must stay self-contained since it cannot source from the plugin before resolving it).

5. **`--root` docs cleanup.** `--root` already auto-detects and prefers `superRA` (verified). Drop the redundant `--root superRA` from canonical examples in instructions/docs so the canonical form is `superra task tree` / `superra dashboard`.

6. **Docs.** Rewrite `skills/task-system/references/internals.md §Setup` and the `skills/task-system/SKILL.md` invocation/dashboard rows to make `uvx`-resolved the canonical end-user/agent form; demote `uv tool install` to an optional convenience; add an explicit warning never to run bare `uv run superra` from a research directory. Update `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`AGENT.md` local-dev guidance only if the canonical contributor form changes (it should remain the `uv run --project skills/task-system` checkout form).

### Validation

- From a non-checkout dir with the plugin installed: the resolved command runs `superra task tree` with no cwd `.venv` created and no `uv tool install`.
- Resolver picks the Claude install when `installed_plugins.json` is present; falls back to the Codex bounded glob when only `~/.codex` has it; falls back to GitHub when neither cache exists.
- Resolution does not perform a full-disk search (assert glob depth bound; time the resolver).
- `superra wrapper init` writes an executable, resolver-carrying `superRA/superra`; re-running it is idempotent.
- `hooks/task-hook` still reconciles via the packaged entry point and now resolves through the same chain.
- No active instruction or doc tells agents to run bare `uv run superra` or to pass `--root superRA` redundantly.

## Planner Guidance

This extends, and stays consistent with, the `wrappers-and-hooks` decision that task trees do not carry brittle *dashboard* launchers: the generated wrapper here is a runtime-**resolving** CLI entry point with no baked generation-time paths, which is what that decision objected to. Keep it that way — no hardcoded plugin/cache/version paths in any committed artifact.

Single-source the bash resolution chain. Duplicated resolver logic between the hook shim and the generated wrapper is the primary drift risk for this task.

Generated role/Codex artifacts are not in scope unless a change touches canonical agent specs; if it does, regenerate via `skills/codex-superra-setup/scripts/sync_codex_agents.py --scope project` rather than hand-editing.

## Results

The `superra` CLI now resolves the task-system package from whatever plugin is **already installed on disk** and runs it with `uvx --from <source>` — no install step, no project `.venv`, always the installed version. The resolution chain is single-sourced in one Python module and embedded identically into both committed shell artifacts so they cannot drift.

### Single source of truth: `wrapper_resolver.py`

[scripts/wrapper_resolver.py](../../../../../skills/task-system/scripts/wrapper_resolver.py) holds the canonical bash resolution chain as one string constant (`RESOLVER_SNIPPET`) and renders the two artifacts that need it:

- `render_wrapper()` → the self-contained `superRA/superra` wrapper a research project's task tree carries.
- `render_hook_shim()` → the committed `hooks/task-hook` PostToolUse shim.

The snippet is **embedded**, not sourced: the generated wrapper lives in a research project that cannot `source` anything from the plugin until *after* it has resolved the plugin, so a shared sourced file is impossible at the wrapper site. Keeping one Python copy and rendering both shells from it is what removes the drift risk the planner guidance flagged. A regression test ([scripts/test_cli.py](../../../../../skills/task-system/scripts/test_cli.py) `test_committed_hook_shim_matches_generator`) asserts the committed `hooks/task-hook` is byte-identical to `render_hook_shim()`, so the committed shim can never silently diverge from the generator.

### Resolution chain (priority order)

`_superra_resolve_source` prints `DIR:<pkg-dir>` for a local source or `GIT:<spec>` for the fallback, then `_superra_run` execs `uvx --from "<source>" superra "$@"`:

1. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` / `PLUGIN_ROOT` env var → `$VAR/skills/task-system` (explicit harness signal).
2. Local checkout (`SUPERRA_REPO_ROOT/skills/task-system/pyproject.toml`) — each artifact sets `SUPERRA_REPO_ROOT` from its **own** on-disk location (the wrapper from `../skills/task-system`, the hook from `${dir%/hooks}`), so a contributor's live edits win over a copied cache snapshot.
3. Claude cache — `python3` reads `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` (`{"plugins": {"superRA@superRA": [records]}}`), picks the record whose `projectPath` is a prefix of `$PWD`, else the user-scope (`projectPath: null`) record, and appends `/skills/task-system` to its `installPath`.
4. Codex cache — bounded depth-3 glob `~/.codex/plugins/cache/*/*/*/skills/task-system` (slug-case agnostic), highest semver via `sort -V`.
5. GitHub fallback — `git+https://github.com/FuZhiyu/superRA.git@main#subdirectory=skills/task-system` (the only pin; lives only in `wrapper_resolver.py`).

Each cache branch is guarded by a `pyproject.toml` existence test, so a stale install that predates the task-system packaging (e.g. this machine's Claude `0.2.0` cache) is correctly skipped and resolution falls through to the next source rather than running a package-less dir.

### Agent-facing command

`superra wrapper init [--root superRA]` writes an executable, resolver-carrying wrapper into the task root (idempotent — re-running produces byte-identical output). `superra wrapper render-hook [--output PATH]` prints or writes the hook shim (used to regenerate the committed `hooks/task-hook`). Both are wired in [scripts/cli.py](../../../../../skills/task-system/scripts/cli.py).

### Hook-shim alignment

[hooks/task-hook](../../../../../hooks/task-hook) is now generated from the same chain (was env→checkout only). It forwards stdin to `superra task hook post-tool-use` via `uvx --from <resolved source>`, falling back to a direct `python3 scripts/task_hook.py` run when `uvx` is unavailable and a local source is reachable, else no-ops. It always exits 0 (never blocks).

### Docs cleanup

- `--root` already auto-detects (preferring `superRA/`, verified live), so the redundant `--root superRA` was dropped from every canonical example across `skills/task-system/SKILL.md`, `references/{internals,commands,planning}.md`, `skills/superplan/{SKILL.md,references/consolidation.md,references/planning-review.md}`, and `README.md`. The canonical form is now `superra task tree` / `superra dashboard`.
- `internals.md §Setup` was rewritten to make the `uvx`-resolved task-tree wrapper the canonical end-user/agent form, demote `uv tool install` to an optional snapshot convenience, and add an explicit warning never to run bare `uv run superra` from a research project (also added to `SKILL.md`). The contributor *invocation* form stays `uv run --project skills/task-system superra …` (`CLAUDE.md` lines 20–21 unchanged); `CLAUDE.md`'s description of the `./superRA/superra` wrapper mechanism was updated to match its new resolve-source + `uvx --from` behavior (`AGENTS.md`/`AGENT.md` are symlinks to `CLAUDE.md`).

### Verification

All checks ran in this session:

- **Real-user path, checkout:** `./superRA/superra task frontier` resolved `superra-task-system @ file:///…/cli-source-resolution/skills/task-system` via `uvx` and listed the frontier — checkout branch wins, isolated env built in uv's cache, no project `.venv` created.
- **Resolver priority (bash-level, from non-checkout dirs):** env var outranks all; project-scope manifest record beats user-scope when `$PWD` matches; Claude manifest beats Codex cache; a manifest install lacking `pyproject.toml` is skipped and falls through to Codex; Codex glob picks highest semver (`0.10.0` > `0.2.0` > `0.1.0`) and ignores a decoy nested below the depth-3 bound; empty caches → GitHub `GIT:` spec.
- **Speed gate:** resolver runs in ~0.01s (3 runs, `/usr/bin/time -p`) — env read + file test + one manifest read + one fixed-depth glob, no full-disk walk.
- **`superra wrapper init`:** writes an executable `superRA/superra`; re-run is byte-identical (idempotent test).
- **Hook shim:** with a `task.md`-write PostToolUse payload it resolved the package via `uvx`, ran the reconcile, and emitted PostToolUse feedback; on a non-matching payload it exits 0 silently.
- **Generated shells are valid bash** (`bash -n` on both render outputs) and **committed `hooks/task-hook` matches the generator** byte-for-byte.
- **Test suite:** `pytest skills/task-system/scripts/test_cli.py skills/task-system/scripts/test_task_system.py` → **312 passed** (27 in `test_cli.py`, including 9 new resolver/wrapper tests).
- **Docs sweep:** no active instruction tells agents to run bare `uv run superra` (only the new explicit prohibitions) or pass `--root superRA` redundantly.

**Final diff self-check** (governing range `1a9f2916..HEAD`): every surviving hunk maps to a scope item — `scripts/wrapper_resolver.py` (new resolver/generator), `scripts/cli.py` (`wrapper` subcommand), regenerated `hooks/task-hook` + `superRA/superra`, `scripts/test_cli.py` (resolver/wrapper tests), the `--root`/`uvx` doc cleanup across the task-system + superplan skills and `README.md`, the `CLAUDE.md` wrapper-mechanism description fix, this `task.md` Results, and the root `superRA/task.md` Sync Map line. No unrelated churn, no conflict markers, no `serve`/debug artifacts.

### Generated-artifact note

`hooks/task-hook` is now a generated file — regenerate with `superra wrapper render-hook --output hooks/task-hook` rather than hand-editing. No canonical agent specs were touched, so the Codex/role generated artifacts under `skills/using-superRA/references/` and `.codex/agents/` are out of scope and untouched.

## Review Notes

Integration + sync review over `git diff 1a9f2916..HEAD` (BASE_HEAD_SHA `1a9f2916`). Sync correctness of trunk merge `5de74de9` was verified independently: the 7 overlapping task-system files (`cli.py`, `SKILL.md`, `references/commands.md`/`internals.md`/`planning.md`, `superplan/SKILL.md`/`references/consolidation.md`) auto-merged with no silent loss on either side — our uvx-resolver/wrapper/`--root` cleanup and the incoming task-read fix / placement ladder / update-task lifecycle / comment-surfacing CLI all coexist in the merged result. Sync Map entry is accurate. Byte-identity (`render-hook` == committed `hooks/task-hook`) and wrapper self-containedness invariants hold post-merge; full `skills/task-system/scripts/` suite 569 passed. No conflict markers, no `serve` artifacts, no debug artifacts.

1. **MAJOR — stale contributor-doc claim contradicted by the diff.** [CLAUDE.md:24](../../../../../CLAUDE.md#L24) still states the repo-local wrapper `./superRA/superra` "dispatches to `uv run --project "$(repo-root)/skills/task-system" superra "$@"`". This task changed that wrapper: it now runs the resolution chain and `exec uvx --from "$source" superra "$@"` (checkout branch resolves to `DIR:<repo>/skills/task-system`). The described dispatch command no longer exists in the wrapper. The Results justify leaving CLAUDE.md unchanged on the grounds that the *contributor invocation form* (lines 20–21, `uv run --project skills/task-system superra …`) is unchanged — that is correct and should stay — but the sentence describing the wrapper's *internal dispatch mechanism* was missed. Fix: update line 24 to describe the wrapper as resolving the installed/checkout source and running it via `uvx --from`, single-sourced from `scripts/wrapper_resolver.py` (the Project Doc Audit walk-up for this file was not fully executed).
   → implemented: rewrote CLAUDE.md:24 to describe the wrapper as resolving the source (checkout → Claude/Codex plugin → GitHub) and running it via `uvx --from "$source"`, pointing to `wrapper_resolver.py` as the single source; AGENTS.md/AGENT.md are symlinks so the one edit covers all three. Results §Docs-cleanup updated to stop claiming CLAUDE.md was left unchanged.

2. **MINOR — missing Final Diff Self-Check trail.** `## Results` has no `**Final diff self-check:**` line naming the governing range and surviving-change classes, which `refactor-and-integrate` asks the integration handoff to leave for the reviewer. The substantive minimum-net-diff requirement is satisfied — every surviving hunk (`wrapper_resolver.py`, `cli.py` wrapper subcommand, regenerated `hooks/task-hook` and `superRA/superra`, `test_cli.py`, doc `--root`/uvx cleanup, `task.md` Results, root `superRA/task.md` Sync Map line) ties to a task scope item, with no unrelated churn — but the trail is absent. This task was approved at implementation stage before the inline sync, so no integration-implementer pass produced the trail; add the one-line trail to `## Results` when addressing item 1.
   → implemented: added a `**Final diff self-check**` paragraph to `## Results` naming the governing range `1a9f2916..HEAD` and mapping each surviving hunk class to its scope item.
