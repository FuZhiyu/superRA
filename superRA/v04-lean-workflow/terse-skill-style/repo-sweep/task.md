title: "Repo Sweep: Restyle Remaining Skill Prose to the Terse Style"
status: in-progress
depends_on: []
---

## Objective

Every instruction file under skills/ matches the terse style at implement-task / review-task density. Behavior-preserving restyle only: protocol content, gates, and ordering constraints survive verbatim in meaning. Done so far: implement-task and using-superra (2e1fbdaa), review-task (f525b63e), superintegrate mature-consolidate.md (35832fe7), using-superra task-companion-files.md (f46265a5). Remaining: workflow skills, stage references, domain and utility skills.

## Planner Guidance

Per file: apply the CLAUDE.md DRY/Necessity gate first (delete lines that fail), then compress to the style (CLAUDE.md §Skill Prose Style). The daea6ae3 failure mode is the check: if the word count barely moves, the pass cut connectives, not clauses.

## Results

Spec test (main agent applying the fresh [CLAUDE.md §Skill Prose Style](../../../../CLAUDE.md)): [superplan/SKILL.md](../../../../skills/superplan/SKILL.md) 1047 → 756 words (−28%), [references/decomposition.md](../../../../skills/superplan/references/decomposition.md) 708 → 539 (−24%). Protocol preserved — all phase gates, tier table, dispatch template, and self-review items survive; the harness contract tests pass (15/15). One consolidation: decomposition's duplicate dependency-edge check merged into Self-Review item 8.

### Group 1 — workflow/orchestration remainder

19 files restyled. Word counts below are **prose only** (fenced code blocks and markdown tables excluded), since several of these files are mostly dispatch templates and shell snippets that must survive verbatim; raw whole-file counts understate the prose cut by up to 10 points.

Protocol preserved: every gate, stop point, status enum, commit-subject grammar, dispatch template, shell snippet, and structured table survives with its content intact. The `Stage:` values, seat-assignment structures, Codex tool map, and availability-routing rows are byte-identical. `tests/harness-instruction-following` passes 126/126 (verified before and after).

[main-agent.md §Workflow Map](../../../../skills/using-superra/references/main-agent.md) is compressed rather than deleted: the phase model — PLAN → IMPLEMENT → INTEGRATE with the one-line ownership statement per phase skill — has no other agent-loaded home on this branch, since the earlier v0.4 restyle (`2e1fbdaa`) removed `using-superra/SKILL.md` §Runtime Workflow Map. Kept in `main-agent.md` rather than reinstated in `using-superra/SKILL.md` so it stays out of every subagent's context; only main agents route on phase ownership.

Caveats:

- The lowest-Δ files (integrate.md −8%, protect.md −9%, main-agent.md −10%, agent-orchestration/SKILL.md −10%, superintegrate/SKILL.md −11%) are step-routing and template files whose surviving prose is mostly section names, return-path routing, and cited anchors. They took two or three compression passes; a further one would start cutting routing content.
- [agent-teams.md](../../../../skills/agent-orchestration/references/agent-teams.md) is marked ARCHIVED and instructs agents not to load or cite it, so its restyle changes no agent behavior. Deleting the file is the cheaper end state — flagged, not acted on, since the sweep's contract is restyle-only.
- `tests/harness-instruction-following/load_contract.json` documents `source_paths` with line ranges that no test asserts; several were already stale before this pass (it cites `agent-orchestration/SKILL.md#L203-L219` in a 123-line file and `codex-instructions.md#L64-L77` in a 58-line file). This pass shifted two more (`agent-orchestration/SKILL.md#L50-L85`, `codex-instructions.md#L64-L77`). Left untouched — a whole-file re-anchoring pass is its own concern.

Remaining for later groups: domain and utility skills, `task-tree`, `semantic-merge`, `result-protection`, `refactor-and-integrate`, and the remaining `using-superra`/`superintegrate` references not listed above.
