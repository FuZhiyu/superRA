title: "Remove Prose Canaries from Live Load Harnesses"

## Objective

Remove authored instruction phrases as expected outputs from always-loaded, stage-load, and domain-load live/fixture harnesses. Preserve behaviorally meaningful evidence: actual skill-load/dispatch/tool events, command execution, file mutations, schemas, and structured identities. Update affected fixtures, expected JSON, harness documentation, and tests. Success: no expected artifact or assertion recites a skill rule; replacement structural/behavioral checks pass with red-green evidence.

## Planner Guidance

Audit inventory: always_loaded_live and its tests/fixture; stage_loads_live and protection/sync/integration/planning-review/maturation fixtures; domain_loads_live and econ/theory/writing/slide/multi-domain fixtures. Delete artifact-token paths that exist only to recite skill concepts; strengthen actual command/tool evidence where available.

## Results
