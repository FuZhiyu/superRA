## Objective

Add an opt-in live smoke that verifies workflow-orchestrator behavior for `superimplement`, using the smallest realistic mock task tree. The test should ask the main agent to run `superimplement` on a trivial frontier and verify structural evidence that it followed the documented dispatch path instead of silently implementing inline.

The smoke should check:

- The main agent enters the `superimplement` path and loads or references the owning workflow contract.
- The main agent loads `agent-orchestration` before writing a dispatch prompt.
- Default behavior attempts implementer subagent dispatch for the frontier task or same-parent bundle.
- Reviewer dispatch is attempted after implementation, or the transcript records a documented fallback reason if the harness cannot expose or run subagents.
- Direct-mode fallback is accepted only when it matches the documented exceptions: no harness subagent support, explicit user override, or task triviality with reviewer dispatch still preserved.

## Planner Guidance

Keep the mock frontier intentionally cheap. The assigned task should be a sentinel-collection or one-file artifact task that can complete in one short turn; the smoke is testing orchestrator dispatch behavior, not implementation quality.

Use structural transcript evidence, not prose claims. Claude evidence may be role-agent dispatch events; Codex evidence may be `spawn_agent(agent_type="superra_implementer")` and `spawn_agent(agent_type="superra_reviewer")` events or the closest JSONL-exposed equivalent. If a harness cannot expose subagent dispatch events, document the limitation and make the smoke skip or assert the strongest observable fallback rather than failing on invisible behavior.

## Results

Added the opt-in orchestrator behavior smoke verifying `superimplement` dispatch behavior on the smallest realistic mock frontier.

- [tests/harness-instruction-following/orchestrator-live-smoke.sh](../../../../../tests/harness-instruction-following/orchestrator-live-smoke.sh) — gated on `RUN_LIVE_HARNESS=1`; `HARNESS=claude` (default) or `HARNESS=codex`. Seeds the bundled `bundle-two-tasks` fixture (same shallow same-parent leaf bundle, so the smoke tests dispatch behavior, not implementation quality), prompts the main agent with `superimplement`, and captures the transcript. Claude path: `claude -p` with the in-tree plugin dir, stream-json, hook events. Codex path: `codex exec --json --ephemeral` with a temporary autoload-hook profile.
- [tests/harness-instruction-following/check_orchestrator_smoke.py](../../../../../tests/harness-instruction-following/check_orchestrator_smoke.py) — evaluator reusing `transcript_assertions.check_orchestrator_dispatches`: requires an implementer subagent dispatch event and a reviewer subagent dispatch event for the frontier. When the harness exposes no dispatch events, it records the documented direct-mode fallback (the agent naming `direct mode` and a `reviewer` dispatch) and passes-with-skip rather than failing on invisible behavior; a silent inline implementation with neither dispatch nor fallback fails.
- The shared `orchestrator_prompt` helper lives in [tests/harness-instruction-following/live_smoke_lib.sh](../../../../../tests/harness-instruction-following/live_smoke_lib.sh) (committed with 03 as foundational shared setup).

**Structural-evidence sources (per planner guidance):** Claude dispatch shows as `Task`/`Agent` tool events carrying `subagent_type`; Codex shows as `spawn_agent(agent_type="superra_implementer"/"superra_reviewer")`. `_agent_type_aliases` in the shared parser bridges `superra_*` ↔ `superRA:*` naming. No prose claims are asserted.

**Harness-evidence limitation (documented in the script header and README):** if a harness cannot expose subagent dispatch events at all, the evaluator falls back to the documented direct-mode exception path (skip-pass) rather than failing on invisible behavior, per the planner guidance.

**Verified without live credentials** (live model calls not run — no spend authorized in this session):
- Gate-off no-op: bare `bash orchestrator-live-smoke.sh` prints SKIP and exits 0.
- Green case: `check_orchestrator_smoke.py --harness codex` passes against the committed `samples/codex-jsonl.orchestrator.jsonl` (implementer + reviewer `spawn_agent` events) — "orchestrator dispatch events observed".
- Fallback case (genuine exception): a transcript naming a `direct mode` switch with `reviewer` preservation **and** a documented exception ("harness lacks subagent support") passes-with-skip (exit 0, limitation recorded: "documented direct-mode exception observed with reviewer preserved").
- Fallback rejection (fabricated reason): a transcript naming `direct mode` + `reviewer` with no documented exception ("I feel like using direct mode today, and I will pretend to be a reviewer too") now exits 1 (missing implementer + reviewer events) instead of skip-passing — the skip-pass requires a documented-exception needle, not bare keyword co-occurrence.
- Red case: a transcript that implements inline with neither dispatch nor fallback exits 1 (missing implementer + reviewer events).
- `bash -n` syntax-clean; unknown `HARNESS` value exits 2; `--harness` arg validation rejects bad input.
- Full CI-safe suite green: `pytest tests/harness-instruction-following` → 24 passed.

**Not run:** the live `superimplement` orchestrator turn (requires logged-in CLI + multi-turn subagent spend). The script is ready; running it is a manual step. Driving a main agent to actually dispatch subagents in headless mode is the most non-deterministic path; the evaluator's skip-pass fallback is the documented safety valve for harnesses that do not surface dispatch events in their transcript.

## Review Notes

1. **MAJOR** — the skip-pass fallback does not verify a documented direct-mode exception, contradicting the Objective ("Direct-mode fallback is accepted only when it matches the documented exceptions: no harness subagent support, explicit user override, or task triviality") and the in-code claim that it detects them. [check_orchestrator_smoke.py:44](../../../../../tests/harness-instruction-following/check_orchestrator_smoke.py#L44) sets `FALLBACK_NEEDLES = ("direct mode", "reviewer")`, and [transcript_assertions.py:315-319](../../../../../tests/harness-instruction-following/transcript_assertions.py#L315-L319) skip-passes whenever any single event contains both substrings. Neither needle encodes any of the three documented exceptions, so a transcript that names "direct mode" with a fabricated/undocumented reason (e.g. a single text event reading "I feel like using direct mode today, and I will pretend to be a reviewer too") passes-with-skip (verified: exit 0, "documented fallback observed"). This is exactly the masking the Objective forbids — the skip-pass is taken on mere keyword co-occurrence, not on a genuinely-documented exception, so a real silent-dispatch failure that happens to mention both words goes undetected. The comment at [check_orchestrator_smoke.py:39-44](../../../../../tests/harness-instruction-following/check_orchestrator_smoke.py#L39-L44) ("the agent must both name direct mode and a documented reason") overclaims, since `"reviewer"` is not a documented reason. Fix: gate the fallback on evidence of at least one of the three documented exceptions (e.g. require co-occurrence of "direct mode" with a needle drawn from the documented-exception vocabulary — no subagent support / user override / trivial-task — in addition to a reviewer-preservation signal), and correct the comment to match what is actually asserted. Update the `## Results` "Fallback case" bullet so the recorded green path reflects a genuinely-documented exception, not a bare `direct mode` + `reviewer` mention.
   → implemented: split the fallback gate into `fallback_required_needles` (direct-mode + reviewer-preservation signal) and `fallback_exception_needles` (the three documented exceptions — no/lacks/without subagent, user requested/override/explicitly, trivial/triviality); the skip-pass now fires only when a single event satisfies `contains_all(required) and contains_any(exception)` ([transcript_assertions.py:295-336](../../../../../tests/harness-instruction-following/transcript_assertions.py#L295-L336), wired in [check_orchestrator_smoke.py:39-65](../../../../../tests/harness-instruction-following/check_orchestrator_smoke.py#L39-L65)). Replaced the overclaiming comment with one matching the actual assertion. Added a red test proving the fabricated "I feel like using direct mode today" transcript exits 1 ([test_transcript_assertions.py:110-145](../../../../../tests/harness-instruction-following/test_transcript_assertions.py#L110-L145)) and kept the genuine-exception case skip-passing; verified end-to-end through `check_orchestrator_smoke.py` (fabricated → exit 1, genuine → exit 0 skip-pass, dispatch → exit 0) and full CI-safe suite 24 passed.
