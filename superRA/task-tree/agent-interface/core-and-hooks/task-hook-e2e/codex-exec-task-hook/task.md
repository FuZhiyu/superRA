## Objective

Extend the optional Codex CLI end-to-end test so a real codex exec session edits a temporary task tree and the test verifies that the PostToolUse task-hook ran for that task edit. The test must assert hook evidence from Codex JSONL and resulting task-tree state, not assistant prose.

## Planner Guidance

Start from tests/hooks/test-codex-e2e-cli.sh. Build a minimal superRA/ tree in TMPROOT, install project-local hooks, prompt Codex to make a deterministic task edit, and assert a PostToolUse task-hook response plus status propagation or hook feedback evidence.
