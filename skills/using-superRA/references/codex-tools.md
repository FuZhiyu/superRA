# Codex Tool Mapping

Skills use Claude Code tool names. When you encounter these in a skill, use your platform equivalent:

| Skill references | Codex equivalent |
|-----------------|------------------|
| `Task` tool (dispatch subagent) | `spawn_agent` (see [Named agent dispatch](#named-agent-dispatch)) |
| Multiple `Task` calls (parallel) | Multiple `spawn_agent` calls |
| Task returns result | `wait` |
| Task completes automatically | `close_agent` to free slot |
| `TodoWrite` (task tracking) | `update_plan` |
| `Skill` tool (invoke a skill) | Skills load natively — just follow the instructions |
| `Read`, `Write`, `Edit` (files) | Use your native file tools |
| `Bash` (run commands) | Use your native shell tools |

## Subagent dispatch requires multi-agent support

Add to your Codex config (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

This enables `spawn_agent`, `wait`, and `close_agent` for skills like `superRA:agent-orchestration`.

## Named agent dispatch

Claude Code skills reference named agent types like `superRA:reviewer` or `superRA:implementer`.
Codex does not have a named agent registry — `spawn_agent` creates generic agents
from built-in roles (`default`, `explorer`, `worker`).

When a skill says to dispatch a named agent type:

1. Find the agent definition (e.g., `agents/reviewer.md` or `agents/implementer.md`)
2. Read the agent definition content
3. Add dispatch context (skill to load, domain reference path, task-specific details)
4. Spawn a `worker` agent with the combined content as the `message`

| Skill instruction | Codex equivalent |
|-------------------|------------------|
| `Agent(subagent_type: "superRA:reviewer")` | `spawn_agent(agent_type="worker", message=...)` with `agents/reviewer.md` content |
| `Task tool (general-purpose)` with inline prompt | `spawn_agent(message=...)` with the same prompt |

### Message framing

The `message` parameter is user-level input, not a system prompt. Structure it
for maximum instruction adherence:

```
Your task is to perform the following. Follow the instructions below exactly.

<agent-instructions>
[filled prompt content from the agent's .md file]
</agent-instructions>

Execute this now. Output ONLY the structured response following the format
specified in the instructions above.
```

- Use task-delegation framing ("Your task is...") rather than persona framing ("You are...")
- Wrap instructions in XML tags — the model treats tagged blocks as authoritative
- End with an explicit execution directive to prevent summarization of the instructions

### When this workaround can be removed

This approach compensates for Codex's plugin system not yet supporting an `agents`
field in `plugin.json`. When `RawPluginManifest` gains an `agents` field, the
plugin can symlink to `agents/` (mirroring the existing `skills/` symlink) and
skills can dispatch named agent types directly.

## Environment Detection

Skills that create worktrees or finish branches should detect their
environment with read-only git commands before proceeding:

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

- `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` → already in a linked worktree (skip creation)
- `BRANCH` empty → detached HEAD (cannot branch/push/PR from sandbox)

See `superRA:worktree-data-sync` §Creating a Worktree for how the
consolidated worktree skill uses these signals (worktree creation +
data sync + cleanup). Finishing a development branch — push, PR, or
discard — is covered by `superRA:merge-workflow` and
`superRA:execution-workflow` Step 4 Option 4.

## Codex App Finishing

When the sandbox blocks branch/push operations (detached HEAD in an
externally managed worktree), the agent commits all work and informs
the user to use the App's native controls:

- **"Create branch"** — names the branch, then commit/push/PR via App UI
- **"Hand off to local"** — transfers work to the user's local checkout

The agent can still run tests, stage files, and output suggested branch
names, commit messages, and PR descriptions for the user to copy.
